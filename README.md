# React-Router

1. Build with the help of universal router.
2. **Currently working upto one level hierarchy.**
3. I wrote a Link function which detects link tag and converted into link.

## Basic Usage

```
In React:
    Instead of <a href="/"> we use <Link to="/">.
And in XReact:
    Instead of <a href="/"> we use XReact.createElement(Link, { to: '/' }, 'link'),
```

## Things not covered

```
1. Support of Route tag
2. Support of Exact keyword
3. increase hierarchy
```
